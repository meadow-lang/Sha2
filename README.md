# sha2

The SHA-2 hash functions of
[FIPS 180-4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final) (SHA-224,
SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256), for
[Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow).

This package is a port of Rust's [`sha2`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes)
0.10.9.

## AI disclosure

Sha2 is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through Claude Code.
Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit messages in this
repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the project's
author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on it, with
that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/Sha2
```

## Use

```meadow
use Sha2 (sha256, digestString, toHex, Sha512t256)

def main =
  ( toHex (sha256 (stringToBytes "abc")),
    -- "ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad"
    toHex (digestString Sha512t256 "abc")
  )
```

| function | |
|---|---|
| `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512` | the digest of some bytes, as bytes |
| `digest alg bytes`, `digestString alg s` | the same for any `Algorithm`: `Sha224`, `Sha256`, `Sha384`, `Sha512`, `Sha512t224` or `Sha512t256` |
| `new alg`, `update hasher bytes`, `finalize hasher` | hashing a piece at a time |
| `outputSize alg` | the digest length in bytes |
| `toHex bytes` | lower-case hex, the usual way to show a digest |

`Sha512t224` and `Sha512t256` are the crate's `Sha512_224` and `Sha512_256`.
Meadow constructor names can't contain `_`.

**Do not use SHA-2 alone to hash passwords.** It is built to be fast, which
makes guessing passwords fast too. Use a password-hashing function instead.

## How it's made

`src/Sha2.mw` translates the crate's portable implementation. The round
constants and initial states in `src/Tables.mw` are generated from the crate.
**`src/Cases.mw`** is generated test data: 404 messages, one of every length up
to 400 bytes (which covers every padding case) plus a few long ones. Each is
hashed by all six functions, both whole and in two pieces, and `meadow test`
checks every digest against the crate's. Run `scripts/generate.sh` to
regenerate; it needs a Rust toolchain.
